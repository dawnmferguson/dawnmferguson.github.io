             <p>
		I have worked for years with molds and casting and wanted to challenege myself a little on the form I chose to mold and cast. 
		Most of the molds I've made have been off of solid forms, creating slump or hump molds, for clay. Knowing that I would be working with silicone offered me the opportunity to work with some new forms.
		I chose a CT scan of lumbar vertabrea because it's an interesting form and I thought it would look dynamic stacked in multiples.      
                </p>

		I played around with using Rhino to do most of the work. Imported the stl file in, and started laying out the box using the method demonstrated in class.

                <p>
		I tried creating an extruded plane to bisect the object, whihc it did nicely, however I was unable to execute a split because my file was a mesh and Rhino can't cut a mesh.
		</p>
		<p.	 <img src="meshtosolid.jpg" width=250></a>		
		<p>	
			I did some research and learned that rhino needs the object to be a solid in order to split so I moved the object to fusion 360 and started working on making it a solid by converting the mesh to brep.

	</p>
			<p> I then tried to split it using construction, split commands. This made the rainbow wheel gods very unhappy. 
			 At some point a lightbulb came on and I realized that I had not tried to see if fusion 360 could split a mesh. More research suggested it was possible.

		<p>
		I started designing a single mold for each side of the split object, using the parts to line up and make sure they were scaled to the same size.

		<p> I had another clarifying moment. I wanted to cast wax instead of plaster, so these would end up beaing vertabrae crayons and each example of cast crayons I looked up were single, ice cube style, molds.
		I think primarily because hot crayon is less than ideal to pour, but it also minimizes exposure to heated wax fumes. I settled on a new solution. 
			I would still cast these as two parts, but do them in the same mold. Once the wax has melted and set (in the oven) then I would spot heat the bottoms and attach them together.

			 My completed mold in rhino and set up to a reasonable scale in Dremel.
