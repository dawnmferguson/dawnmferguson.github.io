             <p>
		I have worked for years with molds and casting and wanted to challenege myself a little on the form I chose to mold and cast. 
		Most of the molds I've made have been off of solid forms, creating slump or hump molds, for clay. Knowing that I would be working with silicone offered me the opportunity to work with some new forms.
		I chose a CT scan of lumbar vertabrea because it's an interesting form and I thought it would look dynamic stacked in multiples.      
                </p>

	<p>
		I played around with using Rhino to do most of the work. Imported the stl file in, and started laying out the box using the method demonstrated in class.

                <p>
		I tried creating an extruded plane to bisect the object, whihc it did nicely, however I was unable to execute a split because my file was a mesh and Rhino can't cut a mesh.
		</p>
		<p.	 <img src="meshtosolid.jpg" width=250></a>		
		<p>	
			I did some research and learned that rhino needs the object to be a solid in order to split so I moved the object to fusion 360 and started working on making it a solid by converting the mesh to brep.

	</p>
			<p> I then tried to split it using construction, split commands. This made the rainbow wheel gods very unhappy. 
			 At some point a lightbulb came on and I realized that I had not tried to see if fusion 360 could split a mesh. More research suggested it was possible.

		Fusion successfully split the mesh

		<p>
		I started designing a single mold for each side of the split object, using the parts to line up and make sure they were scaled to the same size.

		<p> I had another clarifying moment. I wanted to cast wax instead of plaster, so these would end up being vertabrae crayons and each example of cast crayons I looked up were single, ice cube style, molds.
		I think primarily because hot crayon is less than ideal to pour, but it also minimizes exposure to heated wax fumes. I settled on a new solution. 
			I would still cast these as two parts, but do them in the same mold. Once the wax has melted and set (in the oven) then I would spot heat the bottoms and attach them together.

		I measured the Oomoo by weight and mixed for the full 3 minutes, aka until my hands were dead.
	</p>
	<p> <img src="2mold.JPG" width=250></a>
	<p> I left the mold to cure overnight
	</p>
	<p> <img src="melting.jpg" width=250></a>
	<p> After a quick phone call to the Oomoo tech dept. I opted for pan melting the wax. The Oomoo emits some dangerous fumes when heated that would stick to my oven. Saftey First!

<p> The final crayons. 
</p>
<p> There are quite a few things I would do differently if I did this agian. 1- I'd make a 2 part traditional, keyed mold with the silicone. 2- I'd use an additive to my wax to make it flow better. It cooled very quickly which made speed and efficiency a must. 3- I'd go bigger. 4- I'd clean up the scan and soften sharp spots, thicken thin spots.
