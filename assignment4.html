         <h2>Steps Taken:</h2>
             <p>
		I wanted to work with gears for this assignment and had really high hopes to make a rotating bear with a rastered tutu and facial expressions, however my time and skills demanded a more simplified approach.

	</p>
	<p> I built the base in Onshape and thought about using a carriage bolt to attach the gears to the base, but found that was overcomplicated when a simle extruded cylinder would work well. The base has a thickness of 3mm. I built the rectangle first, extruded the shape and then built a second rectangle that I use to take out the interior.
	</p>
                <p>
		I then created two smaller circles on top and extruded them from the surface. At first the small cylinders on topwere hollow, but I played around with the tool until I got them to be solid.Then I used the dimensioning tool to set their distance apart to align with the distance from my gears origin.

		<p>
			I used the featurescript gear generator in Onshape and heavily edited the gears to get what I wanted. They start with sebveral gears. I deleted out the ones I didn't want and started to edit the ones I wanted to keep. 
		</p>	
		<p>	Once I had two gears left I started editing their thickness and size. This caused them to overlap and merge. I then needed to locate the area of the sketch where I could change the distance between the gears by using half the sum of the calculated pitch circle diameter for each gear.

		<p> I loaded them all on one print bed, thanks Cindi Feng for confirming that the Dremel printers could handle this.
