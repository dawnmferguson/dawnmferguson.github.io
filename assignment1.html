             <p>
		Working off the idea of a geodome I started to design my consturction kit to highlight the shapes made by negative space
                </p>
	     <img src="paper_test.jpg" width=250></a>
	<p>
		I tested my design with cardboard and scissors just to work out some angles and overall design.
	</p>

                <p>
			First test cut fit nicely thanks to the measurements taken with the digital calipers. By usig mm grid and ruler in Illustrator I was able to design the parts with the appropriate size from the beginning.

			 <h2>Steps Taken:</h2>
		<p>	
			1.Identified shape to explore
		</p>
		<p> 2.Cut out paper pieces to understand angles </p>
			<p> 3.Started designing shapes in Illustrator by combining shapes and using the scissor tool to eliminate unwanted lines
		</p>
		 <p> 4.Test cut on the laser cutter using 25% speed and 100% power, vector only setting and making sure my source media dimensions were set correctly. I was very grateful for classmate Andrew who was nearby so that I could observe the process of setting the controls before trying it on my own.
		</p>
 		<p> 5.First test fit!! I played around with the lengths of parts and experimented with the size, but ultimately returned to a larger unit because of the cardboard limitations.
		</p>
		<p> 6.Upload the illustrator file with a lot of help from Ping
		</p>
		<p> Final Result in class!!!
