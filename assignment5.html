		I had a lot of fun resrearching this one and there are so many that I would have liked to try making. In the end I settled on a simple open box with fairly symmetrical sides.

		I drew out my overall design and did some visual troubleshooting for how the connections would be made.

			I started with the front side, side A, and created the female joins first. Then I moved on to the male joins and the bottom. In assembly I could see any needed refinements to my geometry.

			<p> I have been really sick all week and have been working on this piece by piece until my eyes glazed over. I got hung up on the fact that my screen prompts did not look like the example. Tyson and Jos√© were very helpful with detailed examples on how to get the file into KiCad and ready for Bantham.

       <p> I finally got it into KiCad.

     Fortunately Ali, my kitty overlord, was able to keep my spirits up. The final piece will be cut when I am no longer spreading my plague upon the land.
