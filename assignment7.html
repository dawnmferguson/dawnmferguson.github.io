		I realy enjoyed creating a form around a pendant lamp earlier in the quarter. I decided to take on a more complicated form and was inspired by this lamp I found on Pinterest. It was unattributed on Pinterest.

		I sketched out the general concept for my lamp. I will be using 8 main components as the "arms" built around that lamp. Four of these arms will come out further to create a stagger of the attched objects.
