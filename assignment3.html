            </p>
    <p> Using the Exo Series by Rakumba, designed by Rowan Turnham, Matthew Harding and Rakumba, I set out to design a form that mirrors a favored double bellied vase form I used to make when I was working as a ceramic artist. 
    </p>
    <p> I created the double belly shade form in Illustrator, using the measurements from my skecth and the lamp parts.

            </p>
    <p> I sketched in the lamp components while I impatiently waited for Amazon to deliver my bulbs.
</p>
    <p>

            </p>
    <p> I designed the piece to hold my shade parts in Rhino, using Rhino's command for polar array and the subtraction method Nadya demonstrated in class.
</p>

            </p>
    <p> I used the program settings demonstrated from class and with generous help from my classmate Tyson.
</p>
    <p> <img src="laserlamp.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
    <p> I then used the laser cutter at 100% power, 10% speed, 10% frequency on a 6x12 birch panel.
</p>

		<img src="lamp2.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
<p> The final result!
</p>
<p> When I do this again I would make the 3d printed piece come out further from the edge so I could arrange the laser cut pieces higher on the lamp. I also would like to cut clear acrylic and make 8 instead of 4 pieces to add around the bulb
